# Changes:  alacritty -> kitty, changed a little bug with multiple child PIDs,
#           & mistake in code 20th line pid -> child_pid, used readlink instead of pushd/popd
#
# Spawn a new instance of Kitty using the CWD of the currently focused
# Kitty process.
#
# This is useful in environment like i3 where terminals are opened using a
# key-combination while another terminal is already focused.
#
# If the script is run with a non-Kitty window in focus or a non-compliant
# version of Kitty, an instance will be spawned in the user's $HOME.
